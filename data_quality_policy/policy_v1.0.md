# 📊 Data Quality Policy (M1→M5, Intraday EMM 5-Minute Strategy) – V.1.0

This policy **places primary focus on 5–10-minute gaps** in the M1 feed. While other types of gaps and aggregate continuity heuristics may also affect results, for inclusion of a year in the core (“headline”) metrics we **deliberately select the frequency of 5–10-minute gaps as the single key quality factor**.  
All other signals are **published for transparency**, but they are **not gating criteria**.

## 📈 Data Quality — 5–10-Minute Gaps by Year (M5 Backtest)

**Rule:** 2001–2008 → ❌ **DROP**. For 2009+ → ✅ **OK** if `Gaps 5–10 min < 120`, else ❌ **DROP**.  
⚠️ **BORDERLINE** if `|cnt_5_10 − 120| ≤ 12`.

## 💡 Rationale (Why 5–10-Minute Gaps Are Prioritized)
For the 5-minute indicator stack, **frequent 5–10-minute gaps** disrupt the construction of M5 bars and break entry/exit triggers.  
Because of this direct mechanical effect, the **annual number of 5–10-minute gaps** is the main determinant of whether a year is suitable for inclusion in headline metrics. Other anomalies are documented, but they **do not determine inclusion**.

---

## 📜 Decision Rule
- **2001–2008:** ❌ **DROP** unconditionally (systemic feed quality problems in early years; used only for stress tests).  
- **2009+:** a year is considered ✅ **OK** for headline if and only if the annual **number of anomalous 5–10-minute gaps** (`cnt_5_10`) is **< 120**. Otherwise → ❌ **DROP**.  
- **Borderline threshold:** ⚠️ a year is marked **BORDERLINE** if `|cnt_5_10 − 120| ≤ 12` (±10% tolerance). Borderline years still follow the main rule (`< 120` → OK; otherwise DROP).

> ℹ️ Other gap categories and continuity metrics are **non-gating**; they are published solely for completeness and interpretability.

## 🧪 Stress Tests
Years **2001–2008** remain **outside** headline metrics and are included **only** in stress tests to illustrate strategy behavior under degraded feed quality.

**How to verify**
```bash
# 1) Verify GPG (we sign the CSV's SHA-256 manifest)
gpg --verify data_quality_table.csv.sha256.asc  data_quality_table.csv.sha256

# 2) Recompute SHA-256 of the CSV and compare with the manifest row
sha256sum data_quality_table.csv
# macOS:
shasum -a 256 data_quality_table.csv

# 3) Verify OTS without a local Bitcoin node
ots verify --no-bitcoin data_quality_table.csv.sha256.ots data_quality_table.csv.sha256
